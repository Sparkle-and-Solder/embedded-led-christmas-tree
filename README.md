# Embedded LED Christmas Tree

Code and 3D files for 130% Embedded LED Christmas Tree

Original: https://www.printables.com/model/13643-embedded-neopixel-led-christmas-tree

My version is scaled up by 30%, plus the holes for the LEDs have been enlarged slightly on some of the stages, in order to fit an individually addressable LED with a PCB board, rather than the plain LED.
